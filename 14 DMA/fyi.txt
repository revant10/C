DMA: Dynamic Memory Allocation.


1. malloc():
-> The “malloc” or “memory allocation” method in C is used to
-> dynamically allocate a "single large block of memory" with the specified size.

2. calloc():
-> The “calloc” or “contiguous allocation” method in C is used to
-> dynamically allocate the "specified number of blocks of memory" of the specified type.

3. free():
-> The “free” method in C is used to dynamically de-allocate the memory.

4. realloc():
-> The “realloc” or “re-allocation” method in C is used to
-> dynamically change the memory allocation of a previously allocated memory.
-> In other words, if the memory previously allocated with the help of malloc
-> or calloc is insufficient, realloc can be used to dynamically re-allocate memory.
